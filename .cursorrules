I am not a python programmer, so when I am writing python code, I need help.
Try to solve problem by provindg revritten code rather than replying how to fix, unless I ask you for it.
This is dev environment and early stages of discovery, so good to rewrite from scratch if too complex.

This is a python project to run API using FastAPI. it will be run using docker compose. It uses concept of  a 'user' and 'organization'. User have roles like 'admin' and 'user'. Organization has users. It needs a superuser (manager of the project).

Need to support creation of CRUD for:
- User
- Organization
- Role
- UserRole (link between user and role)
- UserOrganization (link between user and organization)

Each user can add a site (URL), which is a new object.
Each site can be shared amongst users within an organization.
Organisation admins can delete sites.
Organisation admins can add other admins and users.
Users can be registered by either a superuser or an admin.
Each user can be allocated to a site (and organisation, if created by superuser).
