# User Interface Design Document (UIDD)

## Layout Structure
The interface features a clean, single-page dashboard layout with a fixed sidebar for navigation and a main content area organized in a grid. This structure ensures quick access to essential information while keeping the interface uncluttered.

## Core Components
- **Navigation Sidebar:** Provides quick access to dashboards, reports, and account settings.
- **Dashboard Widgets:** Cards that display security update status, SLA compliance metrics, and module update history.
- **Data Visualization Panels:** Simple charts and tables that illustrate trends and statistics.
- **Notification Center:** A dedicated area for viewing and managing email notifications and alerts.

## Interaction Patterns
- Clickable widgets lead to detailed views.
- Hover effects highlight interactive elements.
- A straightforward login process with support for two-factor authentication.
- Toggle switches for enabling/disabling notifications.

## Visual Design Elements & Color Scheme
- Minimalist design using a neutral color palette accented by primary colors (e.g., blue or green) to denote statuses.
- Flat design elements with clear, intuitive iconography.
- Generous white space to enhance readability and focus.

## Mobile, Web App, Desktop Considerations
- **Mobile:** Responsive design with a collapsible sidebar; widgets stack in a single column for ease of navigation.
- **Web App:** Adaptive layout that maintains clarity and usability across various screen sizes.
- **Desktop:** Multi-widget grid layout that leverages larger screens to display multiple data elements simultaneously.

## Typography
- Clean, sans-serif fonts such as Helvetica or Arial to ensure legibility.
- A clear hierarchy of font sizes to distinguish between headings, subheadings, and body text.

## Accessibility
