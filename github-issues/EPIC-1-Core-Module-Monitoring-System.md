# Epic: Core Module Monitoring System

## Epic Overview
Implement the foundational module tracking system that enables the platform to monitor Drupal modules, their versions, and security updates across multiple sites.

## Business Value
- Enables real-time tracking of module versions across all managed Drupal sites
- Provides critical security update detection capabilities
- Forms the foundation for all reporting and analytics features
- Allows organizations to maintain security compliance

## Scope
### In Scope
- Database models for modules, versions, and site-module relationships
- API endpoints for module management
- Data ingestion system for Drupal sites
- Version comparison logic
- Security update detection
- Basic module history tracking

### Out of Scope
- Email notifications (Epic 4)
- Reporting dashboards (Epic 2)
- SLA tracking (Epic 2)
- Drupal.org API integration (Future)

## Success Criteria
1. Drupal sites can successfully push module data to the platform
2. System accurately tracks current and historical module versions
3. Security updates are detected within 5 minutes of data ingestion
4. API supports bulk updates for sites with 500+ modules
5. All endpoints have 80%+ test coverage
6. Database queries perform within 100ms for typical operations

## Technical Requirements
- PostgreSQL with proper indexing
- Async SQLAlchemy for database operations
- Pydantic for data validation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Audit trail for all changes

## Dependencies
- Existing authentication system
- Site management functionality
- Base database models

## Child Issues
1. Issue 1.1: Implement Module Database Models
2. Issue 1.2: Create Module Management API Endpoints
3. Issue 1.3: Implement Data Ingestion Endpoint
4. Issue 1.4: Add Module Version Comparison Logic
5. Issue 1.5: Implement Security Update Detection
